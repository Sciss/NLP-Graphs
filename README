A thesis project focusing on the usage of dependency graphs as a representation of natural language text. 
Sentences are represented as graph objects, tagged with part-of-speech tags and relations between tokens.
This representation is used as a measure of similarity between two sentences, utilized for plagiarism detection.

The interesting part of the program is mainly GraphEditDistance.java, which is the focus of this thesis.
--------------------------------

Dependencies: java7, maven
a  MongoDB database must be running at the location specified in app.properties  (for a full run, not for calculating graph edit distance between two sentences with GED.java)

Usage:

modify app.properties and select the appropriate folders for the data set.

mvn compile
mvn exec:java
