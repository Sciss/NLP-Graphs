Graph matching refers to the process of evaluating the structural similarity of graphs.
A large number of methods for graph matching have been proposed in recent years.

The time and space complexity of edit distance computation is therefore very high.
Consequently, the edit distance can be computed for graphs of a rather small size only.

However, there exists an algorithm which is known as Munkres’ algorithm that solves the bipartite matching problem in polynomial time.
However, rather than using dynamic programming for ﬁnding an optimal match between the sets of local structure, we make use of Munkres’ algorithm.

Our novel approach for graph edit distance computation is based on the assignment problem.
The assignment problem can be reformulated as ﬁnding an optimal matching in a complete bipartite graph and is therefore also referred to as bipartite graph matching problem.

The solution to this problem is to weight each node and edge operation.
Another solution is to weight the tables and check for damages on the edges.
